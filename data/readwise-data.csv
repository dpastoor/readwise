A manager’s job is to transform his glaring deficiency into a strength by finding the best person to fill it and trusting him to do the job.,Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager,Michael Lopp,B01J53IE1O,,yellow,,location,332
"A manager’s job is to take what skills they have, the ones that got them promoted, and figure out how to make them scale. They do this by building a team that accentuates their strengths and, more importantly, reinforces where they are weak.",Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager,Michael Lopp,B01J53IE1O,,yellow,,location,328
"As such, an origin story acts as a bridge between your concept story and your usage story—bridging the gap between the concept of a product or service and the actual usage of it. It’s where and when potential customers not only see what they can do with a product, but also how they can take an action with it.",The User's Journey: Storymapping Products That People Love,"Donna Lichaw, Eva Lotta-Lamm",B01D95U8UO,,yellow,,location,823

"Some of the things that your team should agree upon before starting will include the following: The initial limits for WIP and any policies that can be in place in order to change those limits or break them temporarily. The process for prioritizing or selecting the features that needs to be done. The policies for the way you will classify your services. This could be things like fixed delivery date, expedite, or standard. Determine if you need to provide estimates. And when the team has to choose the work they will do, how will they make this selection. How often reviews should be done to ensure the system is still working.",Kanban: Workflow Visualized: An Expert's Guide,Gary Metcalfe,B07MM6GDVG,,yellow,,location,210
"A common problem with measurements is that they can change from being the means to control the success of a project to an end in itself. In Seeing like a state, James C. Scott warns about the conflict between two levels of metrics: the ones that provide understanding and control to people outside the process being measured, and the ones that are important for the people inside, affected by the process.",Impact Mapping: Making a big impact with software products and projects,Gojko Adzic,B009KWDKVA,,yellow,,location,356
"In How to Measure Anything, Douglas Hubbard warns about a common psychological tendency to track what is easy to measure instead of what can inform good decisions. Hubbard says that information is valuable if it reduces uncertainty about decisions, and that the “value of measuring a variable is often inversely proportional to the attention it gets”.",Impact Mapping: Making a big impact with software products and projects,Gojko Adzic,B009KWDKVA,,yellow,,location,349
"Based on a seven year long research of companies across the European Union, John McManus and Trevor Wood-Harper list the following as the top five key reasons why IT projects fail: Business reasons Business strategy superseded Business processes change (poor alignment) Poor requirements management Business benefits not clearly communicated or overstated",Impact Mapping: Making a big impact with software products and projects,Gojko Adzic,B009KWDKVA,,yellow,,location,307
"By visually grouping together different deliverables that could contribute to the same impact, maps allow us to spot over-complicated solutions and prevent over-engineering. They facilitate thinking about alternatives, helping delivery teams come up with simpler, cheaper and faster alternative deliverables that achieve the desired effect. Because of this, impact maps make it is easy to argue that more complex solutions should be discarded or at least postponed until simpler suggestions are proven wrong.",Impact Mapping: Making a big impact with software products and projects,Gojko Adzic,B009KWDKVA,,yellow,,location,290
"To use impact maps for roadmap management, you need: agreement that your aim is to achieve a business goal, not deliver pre-set scope frequent, iterative releases to measure progress agreement on metrics that express stakeholder expectations for the central business goal",Impact Mapping: Making a big impact with software products and projects,Gojko Adzic,B009KWDKVA,,yellow,,location,280
"Once a deliverable is shipped, we can measure the actual changes in actors' behaviour and the impact on the overall objective. We can then re-evaluate our strategy and decide whether to continue working on the same part of the map or move on to something else.",Impact Mapping: Making a big impact with software products and projects,Gojko Adzic,B009KWDKVA,,yellow,,location,278
"An impact map communicates scope, goals and priorities, but also assumptions on two levels. The first is that a deliverable will cause a change in behaviour of an actor, produce an impact. The second is that once the impact is achieved, the relevant actor will contribute to the overall objectives.",Impact Mapping: Making a big impact with software products and projects,Gojko Adzic,B009KWDKVA,,yellow,,location,275
"Impact maps bridge the two worlds: they facilitate strategic planning and thinking to create a big-picture view focused on key business objectives, but also facilitate learning through delivery and help us manage project roadmaps. They represent and organise delivery scope in a way that is easy to evolve, reprioritise, grow and shrink as necessary to react to changed market opportunities or new knowledge.",Impact Mapping: Making a big impact with software products and projects,Gojko Adzic,B009KWDKVA,,yellow,,location,256
"An impact map puts all the deliverables in the context of the impacts that they are supposed to support. This helps with breaking deliverables down into independent chunks that provide clear business value, and helps us launch something valuable sooner. A clear hierarchy allows us to group related deliverables, compare them and avoid over-investing in less important actors or impacts. It also helps us to throw out deliverables that do not really contribute to any important impact for a particular goal. Finally, by connecting deliverables to impacts and goals, a map shows the chain of reasoning that led to a feature suggestion, visualising the assumptions of stakeholders. This allows us to scrutinise those decisions better and re-evaluate them as new information becomes available through delivery.",Impact Mapping: Making a big impact with software products and projects,Gojko Adzic,B009KWDKVA,,yellow,,location,212
"Once we have the first three questions answered, we can talk about scope. The third level of an impact map answers the following question: What can we do, as an organisation or a delivery team, to support the required impacts? These are the deliverables, software features and organisational activities.",Impact Mapping: Making a big impact with software products and projects,Gojko Adzic,B009KWDKVA,,yellow,,location,206
"Impacts are not product features. Avoid listing software ideas here, focus on business activities.",Impact Mapping: Making a big impact with software products and projects,Gojko Adzic,B009KWDKVA,,yellow,,location,201
The second level of an impact map sets the actors in the perspective of our business goal. It answers the following questions: How should our actors' behaviour change? How can they help us to achieve the goal? How can they obstruct or prevent us from succeeding? These are the impacts that we're trying to create.,Impact Mapping: Making a big impact with software products and projects,Gojko Adzic,B009KWDKVA,,yellow,,location,188
The first level of an impact map provides answers to the following questions: Who can produce the desired effect? Who can obstruct it? Who are the consumers or users of our product? Who will be impacted by it? These are the actors who can influence the outcome.,Impact Mapping: Making a big impact with software products and projects,Gojko Adzic,B009KWDKVA,,yellow,,location,169
"Goals should not be about building products or delivering project scope. They should explain why such a thing would be useful. Goals should present the problem to be solved, not the solution. Avoid design constraints in a goal definition.",Impact Mapping: Making a big impact with software products and projects,Gojko Adzic,B009KWDKVA,,yellow,,location,162
"The purpose of a goal definition is to allow the delivery organisation and business sponsors to re-evaluate the plan as new information becomes available. For this reason, good goals tend to be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Realistic and Timely.",Impact Mapping: Making a big impact with software products and projects,Gojko Adzic,B009KWDKVA,,yellow,,location,160
"Assumptions validated by consistent data from actual experiments enable the creation of real value. An impact map connects candidate causes with desired effects. It is a map of assumptions connecting causes and effects. It helps you to find the right questions, which is much more difficult than finding good answers.",Impact Mapping: Making a big impact with software products and projects,Gojko Adzic,B009KWDKVA,,yellow,,location,63
"Agile approaches use ‘working software’ as this visualization by rapidly implementing small collections of user stories which non-software disciplines can provide feedback on. However, while working software can validate choices, it does not help a lot with discovering and selecting those sets of user stories whose implementation will delight the people who will use the solution to achieve the overall purpose.",Impact Mapping: Making a big impact with software products and projects,Gojko Adzic,B009KWDKVA,,yellow,,location,37

Baseline metrics are useful for narrowing the solution space that you explore in order to accomplish your investment goals. They are also useful for identifying when you should pause pursuing your goals and instead invest in platform quality.,An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,881
"There are two particularly interesting kinds of goals: investments and baselines. Investments describe a future state that you want to reach, and baselines describe aspects of the present that you want to preserve.",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,872
"The two tests of an effective goal are whether someone who doesn’t know much about an area can get a feel for a goal’s degree of difficulty, and whether afterward they can evaluate if it was successfully achieved.",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,869
Good goals are a composition of four specific kinds of numbers: A target states where you want to reach. A baseline identifies where you are today. A trend describes the current velocity. A time frame sets bounds for the change.,An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,862
"A good vision is composed of: Vision statement: A one- or two-sentence aspirational statement to summarize the rest of the document. This is your core speaking point, which you will repeat at each meeting, planning period, and strategy review. It shouldn’t try to capture every detail of your vision, but it does need to memorably evoke your vision effectively. Value proposition: How will you be valuable to your users and to your company? What kinds of success will you enable them to achieve? There is a sequencing question of whether you should start with capabilities (the next bullet) and reason into value proposition or do the opposite, but I’ve found that starting from your users leads to visions that are both more ambitious and more grounded. Capabilities: What capabilities will the product, platform, or team need in order to deliver on your value proposition? Will it need to support multiple independent business lines? Will it need to deliver against the disparate needs of several distinct customer cohorts? Solved constraints: What are the constraints that you’re limited by today, but that in the future you’ll no longer be constrained by? For example, if you’re currently “spending into” developer velocity, perhaps in the future you’ll be able to achieve significant developer velocity while also maintaining low costs. Future constraints: What are the constraints that you expect to encounter in this wonderful future? Hopefully, these new constraints will be things that are easy to adjust, like funding or hiring. Reference materials: Link all the existing plans, metrics, updates, references, and documents into an appendix for those who want to understand more of the thinking that went into the vision. This allows you to shed complexity from your vision document without sacrificing context. Narrative: Once you’ve written the previous sections, the last step of writing a compelling vision is to synthesize all those details into a short—maybe one-page—narrative that serves as an easy-to-digest summary. In your final document, this is probably the second section, following the statement.",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,815
"If strategies describe the harsh trade-offs necessary to overcome a particular challenge, then visions describe a future in which those trade-offs are no longer mutually exclusive. An effective vision helps folks think beyond the constraints of their local maxima, and lightly aligns progress without requiring tight centralized coordination.",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,810
"When you apply your guiding policies to your diagnosis, you get your actions. Folks are often comfortable with hard decisions in the abstract, but struggle to translate policies into the specific steps to implement them.",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,795
"The diagnosis is a theory describing the challenge at hand. It calls out the factors and constraints that define the challenge, and at its core is a very thorough problem statement.",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,781
"A strategy recommends specific actions that address a given challenge’s constraints. A structure that I’ve found extremely effective13 is described in Good Strategy/Bad Strategy by Richard Rumelt,14 and has three sections: diagnosis, policies, and actions.",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,777
Strategies are grounded documents which explain the trade-offs and actions that will be taken to address a specific challenge. Visions are aspirational documents that enable individuals who don’t work closely together to make decisions that fit together cleanly.,An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,767
"The elements that I’ve found effective for solution validation are: Write a customer letter. Write the launch announcement that you would send after finishing the solution. Are you able to write something exciting, useful, and real? It’s much more useful to test it against your actual users than to rely on your intuition. Identify prior art. How do peers across the industry approach this problem? The fact that others have solved a problem in a certain way doesn’t mean that it’s a great way, but it does at least mean it’s possible. A mild caveat: it’s better to rely on people you have some connection to instead of on conference talks and such, since there is a surprisingly large amount of misinformation out there. Find reference users. Can you find users who are willing to be the first users for the solution? If you can’t, you should be skeptical whether what you’re building is worthwhile. Prefer experimentation over analysis. It’s far more reliable to get good at cheap validation than it is to get great at consistently picking the right solution.",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,732
"Users’ pain. What are the problems that your users experience? It’s useful to go broad via survey mechanisms, as well as to go deep by interviewing a smaller set of interesting individuals across different user segments. Users’ purpose. What motivates your users to engage with your systems? How can you better enable users to accomplish their goals?",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,686
"The first phase of a planning cycle is exploring the different problems that you could pick to solve. It’s surprisingly common to skip this phase, but that, unsurprisingly, leads to inertia-driven local optimization. Taking the time to evaluate which problem to solve is one of the best predictors I’ve found of a team’s long-term performance.",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,683
"These dimensions kind of intuitively make sense as measures of productivity, but let’s see if we can model them into a system that we can use to reason about developer productivity: Pull requests are converted into ready commits based on our code review rate. Ready commits convert into deployed commits at deploy rate. Deployed commits convert into incidents at defect rate. Incidents are remediated into reverted commits at recovery rate. Reverted commits are debugged into new pull requests at debug rate. Linking these pieces together, we see a feedback loop, in which the system’s downstream behavior impacts its upstream behavior. With a sufficiently high defect rate or slow recovery rate, you could easily see a world where each deploy leaves you even further behind.",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,639
four measures of developer velocity: Delivery lead time is the time from the creation of code to its use in production. Deployment frequency is how often you deploy code. Change fail rate is how frequently changes fail. Time to restore service is the time spent recovering from defects.,An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,632
"the idea of organizational debt. This is the organizational sibling of technical debt, and it represents things like biased interview processes and inequitable compensation mechanisms. These are systemic problems that are preventing your organization from reaching its potential. Like technical debt, these risks linger because they are never the most pressing problem. Until that one fateful moment when they are.",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,524
"Finally, a related antipattern is the gatekeeper pattern. Having humans who perform gatekeeping activities creates very odd social dynamics, and is rarely a great use of a human’s time. When at all possible, build systems with sufficient isolation that you can allow most actions to go forward. And when they do occasionally fail, make sure that they fail with a limited blast radius.",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,510
"if you can keep your interfaces generic, then you are able to skip the migration phase of system re-implementation, which tends to be the longest and trickiest phase, and you can iterate much more quickly and maintain fewer concurrent versions. There is absolutely a cost to maintaining this extra layer of indirection, but if you’ve already rewritten a system twice, take the time to abstract the interface as part of the third rewrite and thank yourself later.",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,506
"Finally, the one thing that I’ve found at companies with very few interruptions and have observed almost nowhere else: really great, consistently available documentation. It’s probably even harder to bootstrap documentation into a non-documenting company than it is to bootstrap unit tests into a non-testing company, but the best solution to frequent interruptions I’ve seen is a culture of documentation, documentation reading, and a documentation search that actually works.",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,496
the real productivity killer is not system rewrites but the migrations that follow those rewrites. Poorly designed migrations expand the consequences of this rewrite loop from the individual teams supporting the systems to the entire surrounding organization.,An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,456
"For every additional order of magnitude of engineers, you need to design and maintain a new layer of management. For every ~10 engineers, you need an additional team, which requires more coordination.14 Each engineer means more commits and deployments per day, creating load on your development tools. Most outages are caused by deployments, so more deployments drive more outages, which in turn require incident management, mitigations, and postmortems. Having more engineers leads to more specialized teams and systems, which require increasingly small on-call rotations so that your on-call engineers have enough system context to debug and resolve production issues. Consequently, relative time invested in on-call goes up.",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,427
"The other approach that I’ve seen work well is to rotate individuals for a fixed period into an area that needs help. The fixed duration allows them to retain their identity and membership in their current team, giving their full focus to helping out, rather than splitting their focus between performing the work and finding membership in the new team. This is also a safe way to measure how much slack the team really has!",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,385
"Shifting scope works better than moving people because it avoids re-gelling costs, and it preserves system behavior. Preserving behavior keeps your existing mental model intact, and if it doesn’t work out, you can always revert a workload change with less disruption than would be caused by a staffing change.",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,383
"My rule of thumb is that it takes eight engineers on a team to support a two-tier on-call rotation, so I’m generally reluctant to move any team with membership below that line. However, fixed costs come in many other varieties: “keeping the lights on” work, precommitted contracts, support questions from other teams, etc.",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,358
"Fundamentally, I believe that sustained productivity comes from high-performing teams, and that disassembling a high-performing team leads to a significant loss of productivity, even if the members are fully retained. In this worldview, high-performing teams are sacred, and I’m quite hesitant to disassemble them.",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,344
"Adding new individuals to a team disrupts that team’s gelling process, so I’ve found it much easier to have rapid growth periods for any given team, followed by consolidation/gelling periods during which the team gels. The organization will never stop growing, but each team will.",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,329
"The framework starts with a vocabulary for describing teams and their performance within their surrounding context. Teams are slotted into a continuum of four states: A team is falling behind if each week their backlog is longer than it was the week before. Typically, people are working extremely hard but not making much progress, morale is low, and your users are vocally dissatisfied. A team is treading water if they’re able to get their critical work done, but are not able to start paying down technical debt or begin major new projects. Morale is a bit higher, but people are still working hard, and your users may seem happier because they’ve learned that asking for help won’t go anywhere. A team is repaying debt when they’re able to start paying down technical debt, and are beginning to benefit from the debt repayment snowball: each piece of debt you repay leads to more time to repay more debt. A team is innovating when their technical debt is sustainably low, morale is high, and the majority of work is satisfying new user needs.",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,277
"Fitting together those guiding principles, the playbook that I’ve developed is surprisingly simple and effective: Teams should be six to eight during steady state. To create a new team, grow an existing team to eight to ten, and then bud into two teams of four or five. Never create empty teams. Never leave managers supporting more than eight individuals.",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,257
"Keep innovation and maintenance together. A frequent practice is to spin up a new team to innovate while existing teams are bogged down in maintenance. I’ve historically done this myself, but I’ve moved toward innovating within existing teams.5 This requires very deliberate decision-making and some bravery, but in exchange you’ll get higher morale and a culture of learning, and will avoid creating a two-tiered class system of innovators and maintainers.",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,253
"I’ve sponsored quite a few teams of one or two people, and each time I’ve regretted it. To repeat: I have regretted it every single time. An important property of teams is that they abstract the complexities of the individuals that compose them. Teams with fewer than four individuals are a sufficiently leaky abstraction that they function indistinguishably from individuals. To reason about a small team’s delivery, you’ll have to know about each on-call shift, vacation, and interruption.",An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management,Will Larson,B07QYCHJ7V,,yellow,,location,248
"On-call rotations want eight engineers For production on-call responsibilities,4 I’ve found that two-tier 24/7 support requires eight engineers. As teams holding their own pagers have become increasingly mainstream, this has become an important sizing constraint, and I try to ensure that every engineering team’s steady state is eight people. Shared rotations. It is sometimes necessary to pool multiple teams together to reach the eight engineers necessary for a 24/7 on-call rotation. This is an effective intermediate step toward teams owning their own on-call rotations, but it is not a good long-term solution.

"In moderation, cascading makes an operation more coherent. But when all objectives are cascaded, the process can degrade into a mechanical, color-by-numbers exercise, with four adverse effects: A loss of agility. Even medium-size companies can have six or seven reporting levels. As everyone waits for the waterfall to trickle down from above, and meetings and reviews sprout like weeds, each goal cycle can take weeks or even months to administer. Tightly cascading organizations tend to resist fast and frequent goal setting. Implementation is so cumbersome that quarterly OKRs may prove impractical. A lack of flexibility. Since it takes so much effort to formulate cascaded goals, people are reluctant to revise them mid-cycle. Even minor updates can burden those downstream, who are scrambling to keep their goals aligned. Over time, the system grows onerous to maintain. Marginalized contributors. Rigidly cascaded systems tend to shut out input from frontline employees. In a top-down ecosystem, contributors will hesitate to share goal-related concerns or promising ideas.

"Everything seems important; everything seems urgent. But what really needs to get done?” The answer lies in focused, transparent OKRs. They knit each individual’s work to team efforts, departmental projects, and the overall mission. As a species, we crave connection. In the workplace, we’re naturally curious about what our leaders are doing and how our work weaves into theirs.

But the process didn’t take. Some people never set their individual OKRs; others set them, but stuck them in a drawer. With hindsight, I would have started with our leadership team of five. For structured goal setting to prosper, as our company learned the hard way, executives need to commit to the process. It may take a quarter or two to overcome your managers’ resistance and get them acclimated to OKRs—to view them not as a necessary evil, or some perfunctory exercise, but as a practical tool to fulfill your organization’s top priorities.

Each time you make a commitment, you forfeit your chance to commit to something else. This, of course, is an inevitable, inescapable consequence of allocating any finite resource. People who plan have to have the guts, honesty, and discipline to drop projects as well as to initiate them, to shake their heads “no” as well as to smile “yes.” . . .

At medium-size, rapidly scaling organizations, OKRs are a shared language for execution. They clarify expectations: What do we need to get done (and fast), and who’s working on it? They keep employees aligned, vertically and horizontally. In larger enterprises, OKRs are neon-lit road signs. They demolish silos and cultivate connections among far-flung contributors.

"A large part of project management is limiting the chaos inherent in group work. This step is so important that you can often identify the essence of a project-management methodology by how it limits chaos. In a traditional Waterfall approach, chaos is limited by specifying all the work up front, enforcing a formal change-request procedure, and synchronizing work across teams at predetermined milestones. In Scrum, chaos is limited by planning time-boxed sprints, withholding plan changes until the next sprint, and synchronizing with the customer at the end of each sprint. In Kanban, chaos is limited by directly limiting the amount of work in progress (WIP)—literally, the number of note cards allowed at each step.

They can write their estimates on a slip of paper or use preprinted cards. (Planning poker cards typically follow a geometric or Fibonacci sequence.) Everyone reveals his or her estimate simultaneously so that no one exerts undue influence. If the estimates match, you’re done (write the estimate on the work item note card). If they differ, the high and low estimators explain themselves, the team members discuss their thinking, and then the process repeats until the estimates agree.

This exercise could be part of your Develop or Validate done rule, but I prefer to have a specific step in the workflow to make the practice explicit. Examples of improvements include a more rigorous acceptance criteria definition, modification of development practices such as code review or unit testing procedures, testing in a staging area that mirrors production, or including a user acceptance test stage before releasing to a wider audience.

"If your upstream dependencies define “complete,” “done,” and “ready” as code that is implemented but far from production-ready, you’ll need to mitigate the problem. Here are a few approaches: Treat unstable dependencies as you would late dependencies (described earlier in this section). This includes the options of using a Track column on your signboard, creating fakes or shims, or assisting your upstream partner team with implementation. This approach works best during the early portion of a project, when you’ve got time to do other work or extra work. Implement your work items on top of unstable dependencies, using a combination of fakes and shims to fill in gaps as necessary. You’ll need to create a new task for removing the fakes and shims and validate again when your upstream partner teams stabilize the dependencies. This approach is often required late in a project when you can’t delay implementation any longer. Align your Validate done rule with a lower quality bar. For example, you might replace the rule “The work is deployed to production, tried by a significant subset of real customers, and all issues found are resolved” with “The work is successfully integrated into the main branch, basic test cases function, and all issues found are logged in the bug-tracking system.” This passive “When in Rome, do as the Romans do” approach is far from ideal, but in certain situations, it may be the most pragmatic solution. Push your upstream partner teams to make their deliverables production-ready. Log bugs for every malfunctioning scenario, feature, story, and component; engage your partner teams on every bug; and drive for resolution on those bugs in time to meet your committed delivery dates. This aggressive approach can be effective, but you’ll need executive sponsorship to use it successfully, should your partner teams complain and escalate.",Agile Project Management with Kanban (Developer Best Practices),Eric Brechner,B00U017N4A,,yellow,,location,2428

"My favorite steps that start prior to specification are from Scenario-Focused Engineering (SFE). Here’s what an SFE signboard might look like: The Backlog column contains high-level initiatives, each of which is a desired outcome for a target customer segment, such as “Immersive holographic environment for gamers” (a fictitious example). The Observe step takes a high-level initiative and observes the target customers, capturing everything about who they are, what they do, how they act, and why they care. The Observe done rule might be, “Captured mix of quantitative, qualitative, seeing, and doing customer data, and documented insights from that data.” The Frame step takes customer data and insights and uses them to frame a series of success metrics and SPICIER scenarios. (SPICIER stands for “tells a customer Story,” “includes Personal details,” “is Implementation-free,” “told in the Customer’s voice,” “reveals deep Insight about customer needs,” “includes Emotion and Environment,” and “is based on Research.”) The Frame done rule might be, “Produced a prioritized collection of SPICIER scenarios with associated success metrics.” The Brainstorm step takes a scenario and brainstorms all the different ways it could be brought to life. The choices that best fulfill the scenario and meet the requirements are considered for prototyping. The Brainstorm done rule might be, “Generated a dozen or more alternatives, and settled on three to five promising designs.” The Prototype step takes a design and rapidly conjures a prototype sufficient for customer feedback. That prototype could be a paper model, a PowerPoint animation, or a simple code change that can be the subject of A/B testing. The expectation is that your first guess won’t be quite right, so you want to spend just a few days on two or three variations and then get customer feedback. The Prototype done rule might be, “Captured customer feedback on one or more related prototypes.” Conceptually, note cards from prototyping might move back to the Brainstorm column or earlier if customer feedback indicates that more design work is needed. (In practice, you typically create new cards with a slightly different focus.) The Breakdown step is basically the Specify step from the Kanban quick-start guide (Chapter 2), but here much of the specification is already provided by the previously created scenarios, designs, prototypes, and customer feedback. The Breakdown done rule might be, “All items broken down to less than a week of work each, with specification materials available.” The remaining Implement and Validate steps are as described in the Kanban quick-start guide. You could also add on sections at the end to track deployments as described in Chapter 6. Once your product or service is deployed, you can get more customer feedback on working code, which is then fed back in for observation, framing, and brainstorming new ideas.

"Durable teams are built on a shared purpose that comes from the company itself, and they align themselves with the company’s values (see “Applying Core Values” in Chapter 9 for more on this topic). They have a clear understanding of the company’s mission, and they see how their team fits into this mission.

"Build Trust and Rapport One strategy is to ask a series of questions that are intended to help you get to know the aspects of the person that impact your ability to manage him well. These questions might include: How do you like to be praised, in public or in private? Some people really hate to be praised in public. You want to know this. What is your preferred method of communication for serious feedback? Do you prefer to get such feedback in writing so you have time to digest it, or are you comfortable with less formal verbal feedback? Why did you decide to work here? What are you excited about? How do I know when you’re in a bad mood or annoyed? Are there things that always put you in a bad mood that I should be aware of? Maybe a direct report fasts for religious reasons, which sometimes makes him cranky. Maybe he always gets stressed out while on-call. Maybe he hates reviews season. Are there any manager behaviors that you know you hate? If you asked me this question, my answer would be: skipping or rescheduling 1-1s, neglecting to give me feedback, and avoiding difficult conversations. Do you have any clear career goals that I should know about so I can help you achieve them? Any surprises since you’ve joined, good or bad, that I should know about? Things like: Where are my stock options? You promised me a relocation bonus and I haven’t gotten it yet. Why are we using SVN and not Git? I didn’t expect to be so productive already!

They should have a strong technical background and spend some of their time researching new technologies and staying abreast of trends in the tech industry. They will be expected to help debug and triage critical systems, and should understand the systems they oversee well enough to perform code reviews and help research problems as needed.

"Consider this scenario: Jack is having a hard time with a project, but hasn’t been asking for help with his problems. You finally hear about his struggles. At this point, it’s appropriate to tell Jack that he needs to be more proactive in sharing his progress, even if it means admitting he’s struggling. You could have Jack give you daily updates as a way of helping, but I would only use that much structure for a brief period. The goal here isn’t to punish him with micromanagement for his failure to communicate status, because all you’re doing is punishing yourself and hindering his ability to be held accountable for his own work. Instead, your goal is to teach Jack what he needs to communicate, when, and how. A word of caution, though; if you treat a struggling engineer or project as a massive failure on the part of the individual or manager, she is going to feel that blame and criticism, and instead of giving you more information in the future, she’ll keep hiding it from you as a way of avoiding blame until it’s too late.

"Do remember to be kind. It’s natural and perfectly human to want to be liked by other people. Many of us believe that the way to be liked is to be seen as nice — that niceness is itself the goal. Your goal as a manager, however, should not be to be nice, it should be to be kind. “Nice” is the language of polite society, where you’re trying to get along with strangers or acquaintances. Nice is saying “please” and “thank you” and holding doors for people struggling with bags or strollers. Nice is saying “I’m fine” when asked how you are, instead of “I’m in a really crappy mood and I wish you would leave me alone.” Nice is a good thing in casual conversation. But as a manager, you will have relationships that go deeper, and it’s more important to be kind. It’s kind to tell someone who isn’t ready for promotion that she isn’t ready, and back that up with the work she needs to do to get there. It’s unkind to lead that person on, saying “Maybe you could get promoted,” and then watch her fail. It’s kind to tell someone that his behavior in meetings is disrupting the group. It’s awkward, and uncomfortable, but it’s also part of your job as his manager to have these difficult conversations.",The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change,Camille Fournier,B06XP3GJ7F,,yellow,,location,1888
"Developing basic standards as a team helps everyone communicate with one another in code and design reviews, and it depersonalizes the process of providing technical feedback. For me, basic standards meant things like how much unit testing we expected to happen with each change (generally speaking, as some tests were always required), and at what point technical decisions should be reviewed by a larger group (like when someone wants to add a new language or framework to the stack). As with goal setting, putting standards in place here helps people know which details are important to think about when they’re creating the technology.",The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change,Camille Fournier,B06XP3GJ7F,,yellow,,location,1311

"Autonomy, the ability to have control over some part of your work, is an important element of motivation. This is why micromanagers find it so difficult to retain great teams. When you strip creative and talented people of their autonomy, they lose motivation very quickly.

Or it can be too tight—an overfit model—which means that you’re fitting the noise in the data rather than discovering its underlying structure. The latter error is much more common in practice.,The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail-but Some Don't,Nate Silver,B007V65R54,,yellow,,location,2803

In terms of photographs, stock photo sites are one solid option for finding controlled graphics. In terms of data displays, nonessential gridlines, axis labels, and tick marks can be removed. •   Whether free or for a fee, images should be procured at the right size so they are crisp when presented. Check pixel resolution, dpi, and size. •   Simplified graphics can be altered to draw attention to key areas through the use of selective emphasis techniques. •   A strong visual theme is built when graphic elements, such as portions of the same picture, or the same color, or the same shapes, are repeated throughout the data presentation",Presenting Data Effectively: Communicating Your Findings for Maximum Impact,Stephanie D.

"Adopting Agile practices meant that those initial conversations with clients had to change pretty dramatically. Rather than haggling over how many features we could build within a client’s budget, we explained to them that we would start down a certain path, track our velocity, show them the work every two weeks, and allow them to work with us on changing, adding, or subtracting features as the product took shape. We got a lot of responses like, “Yeah, but how much does it cost and when will I get it?” At first, we struggled to answer those questions. But now that we’ve been working in Agile for a number of years, we have a much clearer sense of what can be accomplished in a given time box and we can provide some fence posts along the way.

"Working in Agile our team feels more like your team. As the project goes on, it becomes clearer and clearer that our interests are truly aligned. With Agile, our profit is maximized by you being successful and continuing to develop the product, whereas the end of a Waterfall project is us trying to maintain our profitability by limiting the number of things you can squeeze in, and limiting the warranty. Though waterfall projects may provide your clients with a seductive sense of certainty at the beginning of a project, they set you down an inherently adversarial path.

You can easily customize that template for working within Agile practices and methodologies: We used this Agile practice in our last iteration of work: We implemented it because we thought it would have this effect toward achieving our North Star goals: The actual effect of this Agile practice was: So, for the next iteration of work, we are changing it in this way: We hope that making this change will have the following effect toward helping us achieve our North Star goals: We will know that this change is succeeding when:",Product Management in Practice: A Real-World Guide to the Key Connective Role of the 21st Century,Matt LeMay,B0778ZX2TX,,yellow,,location,2726

"We knew that we needed to validate the algorithm — the core set of rules we were working on — with the client before we actually built it. So, we put a bunch of rules down on index cards, and told them, “We’re going to play a game with you, and see if the rules of the game lead to the outcomes that you think are right.” For example, one rule might be: “Once you’ve successfully completed three sessions of one-legged squats, then you progress to one-legged squats with weights.” And as we walk through a particular scenario, the client might say, “Oh no, no, no, there’s no way this person would be ready for that yet.” So, we ask, “Okay, what should happen instead?” And then we update the rules and try it again.",Product Management in Practice: A Real-World Guide to the Key Connective Role of the 21st Century,Matt LeMay,B0778ZX2TX,,yellow,,location,2139

"Recognize that a data-driven approach still means that you will have to set priorities and make decisions. Avoid using the word data to generalize specific information. Say what that information is and how it was gathered. Rather than hiding or erasing the assumptions that go into working with data, document those assumptions so that you and your team can address them together. Have a clear and strong point of view about what metrics matter and why. As a thought exercise, ask yourself to decide on the “One Metric That Matters.” If you’re having trouble focusing in, go back to your high-level goals and see if you can make them more specific and actionable. Think through how you will measure a product’s success before you launch it, to avoid having to go back and add instrumentation after a product is already released. Be just as curious and active about understanding metrics moving “the right way” as you are about metrics moving “the wrong way.” Rather than being accountable for a number hitting a target, seek to be accountable for knowing why that number is moving toward or away from that target and having a plan for addressing whatever underlying issues are within your control. Resist the siren call of scores and numbers that purport to tell you “everything that you need to know” about anything. Take the time to understand how these quantitative proxies are developed, and do the work of figuring out what specific questions they can and cannot answer based on your goals and priorities. No matter how complex the data systems you’re working with, resist the pull of jargon. Keep conversations about technical decisions rooted in high-level goals that can be understood by everyone in the organization to make as much room as possible for collaboration.",Product Management in Practice: A Real-World Guide to the Key Connective Role of the 21st Century,Matt LeMay,B0778ZX2TX,,yellow,,location,2153

For example, suppose that you are in a meeting with your engineering team, and there is a disagreement about whether your product development cycle should be two weeks or six weeks. Rather than trying to get everybody to reach consensus — which might never happen — you could say, “What if we commit to trying two-week development cycles, and touching base in a month to see whether this decision is helping us meet our team goals or whether we want to try something else?” This ensures that a decision happens, and creates a shared sense of accountability for measuring its success and adjusting course if needed.",Product Management in Practice: A Real-World Guide to the Key Connective Role of the 21st Century,Matt LeMay,B0778ZX2TX,,yellow,,location,1042

These survival probabilities refer to alarge population of patients, and it is neither feasible nor ethically acceptable to experimenton an entire population. Therefore inferences about the true probabilities and, in particular,their differences must be based on a sample of patients. In this example, even if it werepossible to expose the entire population to one or the other treatment, it is never possible toexpose anyone to both treatments, and therefore statistical inference would still be needed toassess the causal inference—the comparison between the observed outcome in each patientand that patient’s unobserved outcome if exposed to the other treatment.","Bayesian Data Analysis, Third Edition (Chapman & Hall/CRC Texts in Statistical Science)","Andrew Gelman, John B.

"Since the class mechanism implemented this way is essentially working on a per-function level—we have generic functions and implementations of these that are dispatched based on their name—classes and their relationships can be a very messy affair in R. You can alleviate this by thinking about your software design in a more structured way than the language requires. Design your software with classes in mind, implement abstract classes by defining a set of generic functions—you can use comments to group them together and to document that these constitute an interface. Make sure that when you define a concrete class implementing an interface that you don’t forget about any of the functions in the interface. You might not implement them all; sometimes there are good reasons to, and sometimes you are just being pragmatic and not implementing something that might be difficult to achieve, but that you don’t need yet. Make sure that this is a conscious choice, though, and that you haven’t simply forgotten a function.","Advanced Object-Oriented Programming in R: Statistical Programming for Data Science, Analysis and Finance",Thomas Mailund,B0736S4TP7,,yellow,,location,611

"Where generic functions come into play is when you want to do the same semantic operation on objects of different types, but where the implementation of how that operation is done depends on the concrete types.

"When defining generic functions, you can specify “default” functions as well. These are called when UseMethod cannot find a concrete implementation.

"Object-oriented programming was not built into the R language initially but was added later, and unfortunately, more than one object-oriented system was added.

"You will notice that the names of the functions are composed of two parts. Before the “  .  ” (period) you have the names of the generic functions that define a stack, and after the period you have the class name.

"Since all the promises are unevaluated expressions, you don’t have to worry about the order in which you assign the variables. As long as the variables exist when you evaluate a promise, you are fine, and as long as there are no circular dependencies between the expressions, you can figure out all the values when you need them.","Metaprogramming in R: Advanced Statistical Programming for Data Science, Analysis and Finance",Thomas Mailund,B072M6RWRS,,yellow,,location,220
"Using alist, expressions are also automatically quoted. In the earlier example where you wanted the parameter x to default to y, you needed to use quote(y) to keep y as a promise to be evaluated in environment(f) rather than the calling scope. With alist, you do not have to quote y.","Metaprogramming in R: Advanced Statistical Programming for Data Science, Analysis and Finance",Thomas Mailund,B072M6RWRS,,yellow,,location,353
"When a function is called, R sets up an environment for it to evaluate this expression in; this environment is called the evaluation environment for the function call. The evaluation environment is first populated with values for the function’s formal parameters, either provided in the function call or given as default parameters, and then the body executes inside this environment.","Metaprogramming in R: Advanced Statistical Programming for Data Science, Analysis and Finance",Thomas Mailund,B072M6RWRS,,yellow,,location,183
"One way to get the expression that the promises represent is to use the function substitute .

Sometimes, no sensible resource and standard HTTP method can be identified to describe a desired functionality. For example for triggering a batch process. Batch processes are typically long-running processes that run asynchronously. In this case, the functionality is modeled as a controller resource. It is triggered by a POST to the controller resource, which returns a status code 202 Accepted. This merely indicates that the process is submitted. Via location header in the response, the address of a newly created status resource is returned to the client. POST https://domain.com/customers/duplicateRemoval -> 202 Accepted Location: https://domain.com/customers/duplicateRemoval/502034 The status resource allows the client to track the status of the process. The status resource should include fields such as current status and the estimated execution time of the process. The status of the long running process can be obtained by a GET on the status resource, usually by client-side polling. To make polling more efficient, the API can include a recommendation for the polling interval in the status representation.
